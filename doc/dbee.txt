PLATFORM SUPPORT ~

This project aims to be as cross-platform as possible, but there are some
limitations (for example some of the go dependencies only work on certain
platforms). To address this issue, the client implementations are detached from
the main logic and they register themselves to dbee backend on plugin start.
This allows the use of build constraints, which we use to exclued certain
client implementations on certain platforms.

The CI pipeline tries building the binary for GOARCH/GOOS combinations
specified in targets.json <ci/targets.json> - if the builds succeed, they are
stored in a remote bucket <https://github.com/kndndrj/nvim-dbee-bucket> on a
separate branch per run. Additionally, the install manifest
<lua/dbee/install/__manifest.lua> gets created.

To increase cgo cross-platform support, the pipeline uses zig as a C compiler.

To check if your platform is currently supported, check out the mentioned
manifest and the targets file.


MANUAL BINARY INSTALLATION ~

The installation examples include the `build`/`run` functions, which get
triggered once the plugin updates. This should be sufficient for the majority
of users. If that doesn’t include you, then you have a few options:

- just install with the `"go"` option (this performs `go build` under the hood):
    >lua
        require("dbee").install("go")
    <
- Download an already compiled binary from one of urls in the install manifest
    <lua/dbee/install/__manifest.lua>
- `go install` (the install location will vary depending on your local go
    configuration):
    >sh
        go install github.com/kndndrj/nvim-dbee/dbee@<version>
    <
- Clone and build
    >sh
        # Clone the repository and cd into the "go subfolder"
        git clone <this_repo>
        cd <this_repo>/dbee
        # Build the binary (optional output path)
        go build [-o ~/.local/share/nvim/dbee/bin/dbee]
    <

USAGE                                                 *dbee-neovim-dbee-usage*

Call the `setup()` function with an optional config parameter.

>lua
    -- Open/close/toggle the UI.
    require("dbee").open()
    require("dbee").close()
    require("dbee").toggle()
    -- Run a query on the currently active connection.
    require("dbee").execute(query)
    -- Store the current result to file/buffer/yank-register (see "Getting Started").
    require("dbee").store(format, output, opts)
<

The same functions are also available through the `:Dbee` user command.


GETTING STARTED ~

Here are a few steps to quickly get started:

- call the `setup()` function in your `init.lua`
- Specify connections using one or more sources (reffer to |dbee-this-section|).
- When you restart the editor, call `lua require("dbee").open()` to open the UI.
- Navigate to the drawer (tree) and use the following key-bindings to perform
    different actions depending on the context (the mappings can all be changed in
    the config):
    - All nodes:
        - Press `o` to toggle the tree node.
        - Press `r` to manually refresh the tree.
    - Connections:
        - Press `cw` to edit the connection
        - Press `dd` to delete it (if source supports saving, it’s also removed from there - see more
            below.)
        - Press `<CR>` to perform an action - view history or look at helper queries. Pressing `<CR>`
            directly on the connection node will set it as the active one
    - Scratchpads:
        - Press `<CR>` on the `new` node to create a new scratchpad.
        - When you try to save it to disk (`:w`), the path is automatically filled for you. You can
            change the name to anything you want, if you save it to the suggested directory, it will load
            the next time you open DBee.
        - Press `cw` to rename the scratchpad.
        - Press `dd` to delete it (also from disk).
        - Pressing `<CR>` on an existing scratchpad in the drawer will open it in the editor pane.
    - Help:
        - Just view the key bindings.
- Once you selected the connection and created a scratchpad, you can navigate to
    the editor pane (top-right by default) and start writing queries. In editor
    pane, you can use the following actions:
    - Highlight some text in visual mode and press `BB` - this will run the selected query on the
        active connection.
    - If you press `BB` in normal mode, you run the whole scratchpad on the active connection.
- If the request was successful, the results should appear in the "result" buffer
    (bottom right by default). If the total number of results was lower than the
    `page_size` parameter in config (100 by default), all results should already be
    present. If there are more than `page_size` results, you can "page" through
    them using one of the following:

- Once in the "result" buffer, you can yank the results with the following keys:
    - `yaj` yank current row as json (or row range in visual mode)
    - `yac` yank current row as CSV (or row range in visual mode)
    - `yaJ` to yank all rows as json
    - `yaC` to yank all rows as CSV
- The current result (of the active connection) can also be saved to a file,
    yank-register or buffer using `require("dbee").store()` lua function or `:Dbee
    store` Ex command. Here are some examples:
    >lua
        -- All rows as CSV to current buffer:
        require("dbee").store("csv", "buffer", { extra_arg = 0 })
        -- Results from row 2 to row 7 as json to file (index is zero based):
        require("dbee").store("json", "file", { from = 2, to = 7, extra_arg = "path/to/file.json"  })
        -- Yank the first row as table
        require("dbee").store("table", "yank", { from = 0, to = 1 })
        -- Yank the last 2 rows as CSV
        -- (negative indices are interpreted as length+1+index - same as nvim_buf_get_lines())
        -- Be aware that using negative indices requires for the
        -- iterator of the result to be drained completely, which might affect large result sets.
        require("dbee").store("csv", "yank", { from = -3, to = -1 })
    <
- Once you are done or you want to go back to where you were, you can call
    `require("dbee").close()`.


SPECIFYING CONNECTIONS ~

Connection represents an instance of the database client (i.e. one database).
This is how it looks like:

>lua
    {
      id = "optional_identifier" -- only mandatory if you edit a file by hand. IT'S YOUR JOB TO KEEP THESE UNIQUE!
      name = "My Database",
      type = "sqlite", -- type of database driver
      url = "~/path/to/mydb.db",
    }
<

The connections are loaded to dbee using so-called "sources". They can be added
to dbee using the `setup()` function:

>lua
      require("dbee").setup {
        sources = {
          require("dbee.sources").MemorySource:new({
            {
              name = "...",
              type = "...",
              url = "...",
            },
            -- ...
          }),
          require("dbee.sources").EnvSource:new("DBEE_CONNECTIONS"),
          require("dbee.sources").FileSource:new(vim.fn.stdpath("cache") .. "/dbee/persistence.json"),
        },
        -- ...
      },
<

The above sources are just built-ins. Here is a short description of them:

- `MemorySource` just loads the connections you give it as an argument.
- `EnvSource` loads connection from an environment variable Just export the
    variable you gave to the loader and you are good to go:
    >sh
          export DBEE_CONNECTIONS='[
              {
                  "name": "DB from env",
                  "url": "username:password@tcp(host)/database-name",
                  "type": "mysql"
              }
          ]'
    <
- `FileSource` loads connections from a given json file. It also supports editing
    and adding connections interactively

If the source supports saving and editing you can add connections manually
using the "add" item in the drawer. Fill in the values and write the buffer
(`:w`) to save the connection. By default, this will save the connection to the
global connections file and will persist over restarts (because default
`FileSource` supports saving)

Another option is to use "edit" item in the tree and just edit the source
manually.

If you aren’t satisfied with the default capabilities, you can implement your
own source. You just need to fill the `Source` interface and pass it to config
at setup (`:h dbee.sources`).


SECRETS

If you don’t want to have secrets laying around your disk in plain text, you
can use the special placeholders in connection strings (this works using any
method for specifying connections).

Each connection parameter is passed through go templating engine, which has two
available functions:

- `env` for retrieving environment variables and
- `exec` for evaluating shell commands.

The template syntax for functions is the following: `{{ <func> "<param>" }}`.
If you are dealing with json, you need to escape double quotes, so it’s
sometimes better to use backticks instead (`{{ <func> `<param>` }}`).

Example:

Using the `DBEE_CONNECTIONS` environment variable for specifying connections
and exporting secrets to environment:

>sh
    # Define connections
    export DBEE_CONNECTIONS='[
        {
            "name": "{{ exec `echo Hidden Database` }}",
            "url": "postgres://{{ env \"SECRET_DB_USER\" }}:{{ env `SECRET_DB_PASS` }}@localhost:5432/{{ env `SECRET_DB_NAME` }}?sslmode=disable",
            "type": "postgres"
        }
    ]'
    
    # Export secrets
    export SECRET_DB_NAME="secretdb"
    export SECRET_DB_USER="secretuser"
    export SECRET_DB_PASS="secretpass"
<

If you start neovim in the same shell, this will evaluate to the following
connection:

>lua
    { {
      name = "Hidden Database",
      url = "postgres://secretuser:secretpass@localhost:5432/secretdb?sslmode=disable",
      type = "postgres",
    } }
<

Dbee comes with it’s own API interface. It is split into two parts:

- core (interacting with core of the plugin),
- ui (interacting with ui of the plugin).

You can access it like this:

>lua
    require("dbee").api.core.some_func()
    require("dbee").api.ui.some_func()
<

2. DBee Architecture Overview                *dbee-dbee-architecture-overview*

The plugin is created from 2 parts:

- Go backend that interacts with databases,
- Lua frontend which wraps the backend with neat nvim integration.

These two parts should have clearly defined borders and not "leak"
responsibilities.


LUA ARCHITECTURE            *dbee-dbee-architecture-overview-lua-architecture*

The following diagram shows a high level overview of lua packages. Note that a
lot of connections are removed for diagram clarity.

Description:

- The "dbee" package consists of 2 major functional packages, ui and handler
    (core).
    - `handler` or core package is a wrapper around the go backend handler. The only extra thing lua
        handler does on top is information about sources.
    - `ui` package consists of the following packages:
        - `Drawer` represents the tree view. It uses the handler and editor to provide the view of
            connections and notes.
        - `Editor` represents the notepad view. It manages notes per namespace (namespace is an
            arbitrary name - Drawer uses it to have connection-local notes).
        - `Result` represents the results view.
        - `Call Log` represents the history of calls vie view and supports managing past calls.
- `install` package is independent of the other packages and is used for
    installation of the compiled go binary using the manifest generated by the CI
    pipeline.
- `sources` package holds an implementation of some of the most common sources.
- `layouts` package holds the implementation of the default window layout.


GO ARCHITECTURE              *dbee-dbee-architecture-overview-go-architecture*

As We said, the Go backend is accessed exclusively through `handler` in lua.
The way the communication workd both ways is that lua can call the handler
method directly and go triggers events that lua then listens to.

An example of this event based message passing is executing a query on
connection:

- lua registers an event listener to display results.
- lua calls go execute method, which returns call details immediately.
- lua then waits for call to yield some results, to display them.

One way of looking at the handler package in go is that it’s just an
implementation specific use case of the `core` go package.


CORE PACKAGE ~

Here is the godoc <https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/kndndrj/nvim-dbee/dbee/core>
of the core package.

Main construct is a `Connection`. It takes the parameters to connect to the
database and an adapter for the database. Adapter is a provider for specific
databases, which can return a database driver and returns common database
queries (helpers).

Then the connection can execute queries using a driver. This procudes a `Call`.
A call represents a single call to the database and holds it’s state.

Database call returns a result, which transforms the iterator returned from
driver to different formats using a formatter.


ADAPTERS PACKAGE

One of the subpackages of core package is `adapters`. It contains
implemetations of multiple database drivers and adapters. One special thing it
does is that it has it’s own method to create a connection. This is done so
that individual adapters can register themselves on startup in their init
functions (so that we can exclude some adapters on certain
architectures/os-es).


BUILDERS PACKAGE

Another subpackage of `core`, which holds convenience functions for creating
some of the most used constructs. An example are multiple implementations of
the `ResultStream` interface.
